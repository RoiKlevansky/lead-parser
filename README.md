# A Fair Warning

| This project is a work in progress. It is not meant to be a final product. It has to deal with unrealistic amounts of unformatted data which means that a fair bit of regex and hacky code is used. A lot of the times this wide support of formats may come at a price of code cleanliness, readability, maintainability and eventually performance. |
